## Introduction

*Very briefly describe what your program does.*

## Program design

*Here you go over the structure of the program. Try not to go too in-depth here implementation-wise, but rather discuss the important components and relations between them. If you think it can help, feel free to add a simple diagram here. The design of the program should be clear to the reader.
A good way to split this section would be by packages (e.g. `model/view/controller`). Then discuss the (functionality of) relevant components in each package and how they interact with each other. Make sure to cover every package/module.
Additionally, you should include some design decisions in here. There is no need to provide an explanation for every single thing, but there are often multiple ways of implementing a feature and in those cases it makes sense to state why you chose one over the other.*

## Evaluation of the program

*Discuss the stability of your implementation. What works well? Are there any bugs? Is everything tested properly? Are there still features that have not been implemented? Also, if you had the time, what improvements would you make to your implementation? Are there things which you would have done completely differently?*

## Process evaluation

*Describe shortly the process that led to the final code and the report. What was easy, what was difficult? Did you make interesting mistakes? What have you learned from this assignment? Moreover, describe the work distribution in this section.*

## Conclusions

*Add a very short summary/concluding remarks here*
